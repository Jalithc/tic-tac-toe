# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This Python program allows users to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against another player or against an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Two-player Mode**: Play against a friend on the same computer.
- **Single-player Mode**: Challenge the computer AI with varying difficulty levels.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
